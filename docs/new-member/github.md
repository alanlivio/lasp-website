The LASP has a Github organisation to store code from published papers or reusable material in this link: [https://github.com/LASP-UCL](https://github.com/LASP-UCL). If you are a new member, please ask to be included.

The LASP truly believes that availability and reproducibility are essential to performing good research papers. Therefore, we recommend that our members create code repositories for their published papers and, most importantly, follow good research guidelines of code sharing.

- The ACM guidelines recommend that research code be publically available, such as to enable any interested party to audit them and to reproduce results. It defines levels of reproducibility of code (called artefact). See more at: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging).
- NeurIPS proposes an ML Code Completeness Checklist of five items: (1)Â  Specification of dependencies; (2) Training code; (3) Evaluation code; (4) Pre-trained models; (5) README. See more at: [https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code).
- You can use this GitHub repository template as a starting point of your GitHub repository: [https://github.com/LASP-UCL/publication](https://github.com/LASP-UCL/publication). See how to create a repository from a template at [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

I am currently a postdoc at UCL working on Immersive Media, and previously I received a Ph.D. from PUC-Rio and M.Sc. from UFPB. I have been working in my career with video/TV/ML projects, research (SBC WebMedia and ACM SIGMM), and standard committees (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU SG16). My research interests are Multimedia Systems and Immersive Media. I seek to get involved in purpose-driven research with technology transfer to industry or social impact.

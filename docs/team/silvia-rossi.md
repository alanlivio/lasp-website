PostDoc at [DIS group](https://www.dis.cwi.nl), CWI (The Netherland).  
**Information Director** of [ACM SIGMM Records](https://records.sigmm.org).  
**PhD** at Electronic & Electrical Department, UCL (UK).


I received my [Laurea Triennale and Magistrale in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering for Energy](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ElectronicsTelecommunicationsEngineeringEnergy) (they are comparable to BSc and MSc degrees) from **University of Bologna** – [Campus of Cesena](https://www.unibo.it/en/campus-cesena/studying-at-cesena/studying-at-cesena) in 2013 and 2016, respectively. From September 2015 to March 2016, I was a visiting student at [WMN](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/faculties/science-engineering-and-computing/research/research-centres/dirc/wireless-multimedia-and-networking/) (Wireless Multimedia Networking) laboratory at **Kingston University**, London to prepare my final dissertation under the supervision of [Prof. Maria Martini](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/staff/profile/professor-maria-martini-290/).  
In May 2017, after a five months internship,  I joined [LASP group](https://laspucl2016.wpcomstaging.com) as the first PhD student. From October 2020 to June 2021, I was a visiting student at [DIS](https://www.dis.cwi.nl) (Distributed & Interactive Systems) group in CWI, Amsterdam under the supervision of [Prof. Pablo Cesar](https://www.pablocesar.me) and [Dr Irene Viola](https://www.ireneviola.com). My PhD thesis is “[_Understanding user interactivity for the next-generation immersive communication: design, optimisation, and behavioural analysis_](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10143615/)_”_.  
I have recently joined [DIS](https://www.dis.cwi.nl) (Distributed & Interactive Systems) group in CWI (The Netherlands) as a postdoc thanks to an [ERCIM fellowship](https://fellowship.ercim.eu).  
  
Truly passionate about multimedia and technology, my research interests are at the crossroad between multimedia processing, data processing and analysis, machine learning, and communication systems.

Prior to joining UCL, I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Electrical Engineering at the University of Coimbra (Portugal)

My research interests lie in the emerging field of graph signal processing for volumetric content with the specific twist of graph learning for new modalities representations and processing.

 In February of 2020, I joined the LASP group at UCL as a PhD student within the project of _machine learning algorithms for immersive communication_.
